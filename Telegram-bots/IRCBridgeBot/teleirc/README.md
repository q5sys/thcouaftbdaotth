Requirements
------------

On Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install libicu-dev
```


Quick start
-----------

Make sure you've installed Node.js.

1. Install the teleirc npm module with `npm install -g teleirc` (might need
   sudo)
2. Generate a default config using `teleirc --genconfig`
   NOTE: if this step fails, try `mkdir ~/.teleirc` and run the command again (FIXME).
3. Set up your bot with [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather)
4. Use the `/setprivacy` command with `BotFather` to allow your bot to see all
   messages in your group (NOTE on usage: bot name is preceded by @ sign and
   'Disable' is case-sensitive)
5. Edit the default config `$EDITOR ~/.teleirc/config.js`
6. Run `teleirc`
7. Invite your bot to any Telegram groups you've configured it for
8. Greet your bot once on each of your Telegram groups :tada:! This is needed
   to fetch (and store!) an internally used group ID, making communication from
   IRC to the correct Telegram group possible.

Optional:

- For your convenience, there is an included systemd unit file:
  [teleirc.service](extras/teleirc.service)
- You can change your Telegram Bot's profile picture with the `/setuserpic`
  BotFather command. [Here's](/extras/icon.png) an example icon for you.
- You can tell Telegram which commands the teleirc bot supports by using the
  `/setcommands` BotFather command. You may copy-paste the contents of
  [`commands.txt`](/extras/commands.txt) to show all supported commands to
  Telegram clients.
- Instead of enabling the HTTP server for serving sent media files, photo files
  sent to the groups can be uploaded to [Imgur](http://imgur.com/). See the
  [README for Imgur](extras/Imgur_README.md) for more information.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. Check your system clock. By default if a Telegram message's timestamp is
   older than one minute compared to your system clock, the message is skipped.
   You can configure this behaviour via `config.maxMsgAge`.
2. Make sure your Telegram group's name and IRC channel has been entered
   correctly in your config (case sensitive!)
3. Run with verbose flags to see more output: `teleirc -vvv`
